 # TTS Confusion Script

## Overview
This repository contains a Python script designed to generate random and complex strings of text. The primary purpose is to create sequences that are challenging for text-to-speech (TTS) systems to process.

## How It Works
The script uses the Python `random` library to generate sequences of days, dates, months, numbers, tongue twisters, and unusually long words. These sequences are then shuffled to further enhance the complexity.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Usage
Run the script using a Python interpreter:
```bash
python tts_confusion_script.py
